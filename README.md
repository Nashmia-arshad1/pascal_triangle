# 1st Project on git_hub
This C++ project implements a program to generate Pascal's Triangle, a well-known mathematical construct that showcases binomial coefficients. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It starts with a 1 at the top and builds downwards, with each row representing the coefficients of the binomial expansion.
# 2nd project
This c++ program is used two take two binary numbers as string and output result as the addition of both of these Binary number .
# 3rd project
This program defines a Matrix class that handles basic matrix operations such as addition and subtraction.
